## Session 1: Initial Setup & Phase 1.1 Start
**Date:** Initial setup  
**Phase:** M1 - Phase 1.1

### Actions Taken
1. Created planning files (`task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md`)
2. Reviewed Roadmap.md Phase 1.1 requirements
3. Attempted Rust installation (SSL issue encountered)
4. Created complete Rust workspace structure:
   - 5 workspace crates (indexer, api, routing, contracts, sdk-rust)
   - All crate Cargo.toml files configured
   - Basic source file structure with error types and modules
5. Set up Docker Compose for Postgres and Redis
6. Configured GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
7. Created comprehensive documentation structure
8. Added setup script for automation
9. Created .gitignore file

### Current Status
- Planning files created ✅
- Project structure initialized ✅
- CI/CD configured ✅
- Docker Compose setup complete ✅
- Documentation structure created ✅
- Rust installation needs manual setup (documented)
- Soroban CLI installation needs manual setup (documented)

### Next Actions
1. Manually install Rust (see docs/development/SETUP.md)
2. Install Soroban CLI (see docs/development/SETUP.md)
3. Start Docker services: `docker-compose up -d`
4. Verify build: `cargo build`
5. Begin Phase 1.2: SDEX Indexer Development

### Test Results
- N/A (not yet testing - project structure created but Rust not installed)
