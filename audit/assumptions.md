# Security Assumptions

## Runtime Assumptions

1. **Soroban runtime is correct**: We assume the Soroban VM executes contract code faithfully, enforces storage isolation, and correctly manages authentication via `require_auth()`.

2. **Single-threaded execution**: Each contract invocation is processed atomically. No concurrent state mutations within a single invocation.

3. **Storage integrity**: Instance and persistent storage behave as documented. Data persists as long as TTLs are maintained.

4. **Cryptographic primitives**: Address verification, signatures, and hashing provided by the Soroban SDK are secure.

## Operational Assumptions

5. **Admin key security**: The admin private key is stored securely (hardware wallet or encrypted vault). Compromise of the admin key allows full contract control.

6. **Pool vetting**: Only vetted, audited liquidity pool contracts are registered. The router trusts registered pools to return honest swap outputs.

7. **TTL maintenance**: Operational scripts or automated processes will extend storage TTLs before expiry. If TTLs expire, contract state is lost and redeployment is required.

8. **Network availability**: The Stellar network and Soroban RPC endpoints are available for contract interactions.

## Trust Boundaries

| Boundary | Trusted Side | Untrusted Side |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Admin authentication | Soroban `require_auth()` | External callers |
| Pool contract calls | Router invocation logic | Pool return values |
| Storage persistence | Soroban storage layer | TTL expiry (time-based) |
| Fee calculation | Contract arithmetic | User-supplied route data |

## What We Do NOT Assume

- Pool contracts are bug-free (we handle call failures gracefully).
- Users provide optimal routes (the contract validates but does not optimize).
- The admin acts honestly (governance is out of scope for the contract layer).
- Gas/resource costs remain stable (fee parameters may need adjustment).
